#Burp Suite comes as a jar package while upgrading from Debian to Kali which can be difficult to update. 
#At most times it will mess with the configured settings, so I have created a documentation to do this safely.

Step 1: Open a Temp VM.
Step 2: Go to "https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/community/latest", select "jar" version and click download.
Step 3: After downloading jar file, click on "show checksums" to view checksums.
Step 4: Open downloads folder and run below command to compare checksums:-

```shell_session

$ sha256sum burpsuite_community_XXX.jar

```where XXX is the version number. 

Step 5: Rename this file as "burpsuite.jar" and move it to your Kali Template.
Step 6: Open a terinal in your Kali Template and navigate to QubesIncoming folder of received file.
Step 7: In same folder, run this command:-

```shell_session

$ sudo mv burpsuite.jar /usr/share/burpsuite/

```

Congratulations, your Burp Suite has been updated to latest version. You can close the Kali Template now.
