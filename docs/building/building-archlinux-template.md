# Building the 'archlinux-minimal' Qubes template
> **These instructions are for Qubes 4.0.4 and 4.1.**

Guide status:
- 4.0.4 :
- 4.1-beta1 : validated (2021-07-31) by the commit author of this line.

- 4.1 : validated (2022-04-05) by the commit author of this line. 

## Steps

### 1. Open a non-root ($) terminal in the 'fedora-34' TemplateVM.
> **How to see whether the `'GNUMAKEFLAGS'` or `'MAKEFLAGS'` environment variable is used: \
`$ strings /usr/bin/make | grep MAKEFLAGS` \
GNU Make's `-l` set to same value as `-j` prevents CPU overcommitment.**

* `#`Edit: `/etc/profile.d/99-makeflags.sh`
```sh
export GNUMAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc) -l$(nproc)"
export MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc) -l$(nproc)"
```
> **The StandaloneVM type cannot build the Arch Linux (minimal or not) template currently, as its Makefiles and Scripts only fully accomodate for the AppVM type's set of filesystem permissions.**

![arch-template-01](/attachment/wiki/ArchlinuxTemplate/arch-template-01.png)

* Allow at least 15GB of space in the Qube's private storage, then run the following commands:
```console
$ qvm-prefs build-archlinux2 vcpus $(nproc)
$ qvm-prefs build-archlinux2 memory 4000
$ qvm-prefs build-archlinux2 maxmem 4000
```
> **`nproc` specified the number of CPU logical cores it detected, meaning memory usage will increase for compilations that utilize the additional logical cores. For building the 'archlinux-minimal' template, 4000MB should be plenty.**

### 3. Downloading and verifying the integrity of the "Qubes Automated Build System"
#### Open a terminal in the `build-archlinux2` AppVM
* Set terminal size to 30 lines and 100 columns; ensures text from **qubes-builder**'s setup script isn't cut-off.
```console
$ resize -s 30 100
```
* Install initial dependencies without user confirmation.
```console
# dnf install -y git make
```
* Import and verify the Qubes master key; [to understand the purpose of GPG (a frontend for PGP)](https://www.qubes-os.org/security/verifying-signatures/).
```console
$ gpg2 --import /usr/share/qubes/qubes-master-key.asc
$ gpg2 --edit-key 0x427F11FD0FAA4B080123F01CDDFA1A3E36879494
```
```

```
* Download then import the Qubes developers' keys:
```console
$ curl -O https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-developers-keys.asc
$ gpg2 --import qubes-developers-keys.asc
```
> **`$HOME` is always defined; see the POSIX 2017 standard for more information: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/**

* Download the latest stable `qubes-builder` repository:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder.git $HOME/qubes-builder/
```
* Verify the integrity of the `qubes-builder` repository:
```console
$ cd $HOME/qubes-builder/
$ git tag -v $(git describe)
```
```
gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-GÃ³recki (Qubes OS signing key) <marmarek@invisiblethingslab.com>" [full]
```
* Install the remaining dependencies:
```console
$ make install-deps
```

___
### 4. Configure the `builder.conf` file
> **The manual way is copying an example config like `$HOME/qubes-builder/example-configs/qubes-os-r4.0.conf` to `$HOME/qubes-builder/builder.conf`, then editing that copied file.**

<details><summary>Setup script method</summary>

### 5. Make all the require Qubes components
* Required before proceeding:
```console
$ make remount
$ make install-deps
$ make get-sources
```
* {Preferred} Building all Qubes components (this can take a long time): 
```console
$ make qubes-vm
```
* {Debugging/development} Individual 'make' commands for Qubes components:
```console
$ make vmm-xen-vm
$ make core-vchan-xen-vm
$ make core-qubesdb-vm
$ make core-qrexec-vm
$ make linux-utils-vm
$ make core-agent-linux-vm
$ make gui-common-vm
$ make gui-agent-linux-vm
$ make app-linux-split-gpg-vm
$ make app-linux-usb-proxy-vm
$ make meta-packages-vm
```

___
### 6. Build the actual Arch Linux template
```console
# make template
```

___
### 7. Transfer 'archlinux-minimal' template into Dom0
* You need to ensure these two files are in the `noarch` directory:
```console
$ cd $HOME/qubes-builder/qubes-src/linux-template-builder/rpm/
$ ls
install-templates.sh
$ cd noarch
$ ls
qubes-template-archlinux-*.*.*-*.noarch.rpm
```

![arch-template-16](/attachment/wiki/ArchlinuxTemplate/arch-template-16.png)

*   **Transfer the install-templates.sh script file into Dom0**
  > **There are more steps involved for file transfering to Dom0 since it's considered unsafe. \
  You accept full responsibility if Dom0 is compromised due to this file transfer.**
* Open a terminal in Dom0, and execute the following commands:
```console
$ qvm-run --pass-io build-archlinux2 'cat $HOME/qubes-builder/qubes-src/linux-template-builder/rpm/install-templates.sh' > install-templates.sh
$ chmod +x install-templates.sh
$ ./install-templates.sh
```
* If the build process went smoothly, the 'archlinux' and/or 'archlinux-minimal' template will be listed in Qubes Manager.

## Debugging the build process
Arch Linux is a [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release) distro, making it a fragile template for Qubes.
It's important to understand how to debug Qubes templates, fix, then do a pull request.

See below explanations and examples which (we hope) will help you to solve the common problems, and do a pull request with your solution.

[neowutran's semi-automated 'archlinux-minimal' Qubes template builder script](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/code/OS-administration/build-archlinux.sh). \
The most important part about this script is where to add custom code that is not in the Qubes OS repositories.

<!-- Whoever made these lines need to clarify what this is about.

After the command:
```console
$ make get-sources
```
And before the command:
```console
$ make qubes-vm
```
-->

You can put your custom code by replacing the `qubes-src/` directories.
For example: 
```console
$ rm -Rf "$directory/qubes-src/gui-agent-linux/"
$ cp -R ~/qubes-gui-agent-linux "$directory/qubes-src/gui-agent-linux"
```

### UseCase : Xorg

Launch the build:
```console
$ ./build_arch.sh
```
It crashed with the following output:
```
Makefile:202: target 'builder-archlinux.get-sources' given more than once in the same rule
Makefile:204: target 'builder-archlinux.get-sources-extra' given more than once in the same rule
Makefile:225: target 'builder-archlinux-vm' given more than once in the same rule
Makefile:237: target 'builder-archlinux-dom0' given more than once in the same rule
Makefile:585: target 'builder-archlinux.grep' given more than once in the same rule
-> Building template archlinux (logfile: build-logs/template-archlinux.log)...
make: *** [Makefile:319: template-local-archlinux+minimal] Error 1
```
Let's check `build-logs/template-archlinux.log`:
```
--> Finishing installation of qubes packages...
resolving dependencies...
warning: cannot resolve "xorg-server<1.20.7", a dependency of "qubes-vm-gui"
:: The following package cannot be upgraded due to unresolvable dependencies:
      qubes-vm-gui

:: Do you want to skip the above package for this upgrade? [y/N] error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)

:: unable to satisfy dependency 'xorg-server<1.20.7' required by qubes-vm-gui
make[1]: *** [Makefile:64: rootimg-build] Error 1
```
The xorg-server package was probably updated to a version greater than 1.20.7.
Let's search what is the current version of xorg-server... Currently, it is **1.20.7-1**.
Neither a fix nor a minor version change is likely to break things.
So let's find the dependency for "**xorg-server<1.20.7**" and change it to "**xorg-server<1.21**".

> **rg stands for [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), an alternative to GNU grep.**

```console
$ rg -iuu "xorg-server<1.20.7" ./qubes-builder/qubes-src/ 2> /dev/null
./qubes-builder/qubes-src/gui-agent-linux/archlinux/PKGBUILD
55:		'xorg-server>=1.20.4' 'xorg-server<1.20.7'
```
So the **/archlinux/PKGBUILD** file of the repository "qubes-gui-agent-linux" requires modification. \
Git clone "qubes-gui-agent-linux", git checkout to the correct branch (example: `release4.0` instead of master), and then attempt a modification on the **/archlinux/PKGBUILD** file. \
In your building script, right before the "make qubes-vm", remove the existing "gui-agent-linux" folder and replace it with your own.
Example, add this to the script:
```sh
rm -Rf "~/qubes-builder/qubes-src/gui-agent-linux/"
cp -R ~/qubes-gui-agent-linux "~/qubes-builder/qubes-src/gui-agent-linux"
```
Then try building the template.
If the template built successfully and works as expected, do a pull request on GitHub to share your fix(es). 

### UseCase: Missing pulsecore error when building the gui-agent-linux

```console
$ make
module-vchan-sink.c:64:10: fatal error: pulsecore/core-error.h: No such file or directory
   64 | #include <pulsecore/core-error.h>
      |          ^```````````````~~~
```
This error is caused by Arch Linux having a newer version of PulseAudio than the PulseAudio headers imported by the Qubes team.
It can be fixed by downloading the new version of the headers, and rebuilding.
This solution prevents any breaking API changes from going silently unnoticed.

> **Replace 14.2 with your version (with additional suffixes such as -PATCH removed)**

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/pulseaudio/pulseaudio.git $HOME/git/pulseaudio
$ cd $HOME/git/pulseaudio
$ git checkout v14.2
$ cd $HOME/qubes-builder/qubes-src/gui-agent-linux/pulse/
$ cp -r $HOME/git/pulseaudio/src/pulsecore/pulsecore-14.2/ #symlink didn't work
```
Or simply use the old headers and hope nothing breaks unexpectedly later:
```console
$ cd $HOME/qubes-builder/qubes-src/gui-agent-linux/pulse/
$ ln -sr pulsecore-14.1 pulsecore-14.2
```

During the template building process an error ocurred, corrupting the group id of the /dev/xen/* files.
To fix this you'll need to assign the correct permissions, so you'll have to enter the following <b> while `make template` is running: </b>
```console
sudo chgrp qubes /dev/xen/*
```




## Debugging the Qubes-ArchLinux runtime
If you are able to launch a terminal and execute command, utilize your Arch-fu to fix the issue. \
If unable to launch a terminal, shutdown the qube, create a new DisposableVM, [mount an Arch Linux ISO in a DisposableVM](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/mount-lvm-image/), chroot to it, and then use your Arch-fu. \
Example of this kind of debugging [that happened on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Qubes/comments/eg50ne/built_arch_linux_template_and_installed_but_app/).

### Question
Hello.
I just built an 'archlinux' template and moved it to Dom0, then installed the template.
Afterwards I tried to open a terminal in the 'archlinux' TemplateVM, but it shows nothing. \
Can you please check this logs and please tell me what is wrong. Thanks.

I searched the word "Failed" and found few:
```
[0m] Failed to start..... Initialize and mount /rw and /home.... see 'systemctl status qubes-mount-dirs.service' for details
[0m] Failed unmounting.... /usr/lib/modules....

failed to mount moving /proc to /sysroot/dev: Invalid argument
failed to mount moving /sys to /sysroot/dev: Invalid argument

when I tried to run terminal, in log says

```
I tried to rebuild the 'archlinux' template and got the same issue. \
How can I debug this Qube?

### Answer
The issue came from a systemd unit named "qubes-mount-dirs". We want to know more about that. \
We can't execute command into the qube, so let's shut it down.
Then, we mount the 'archlinux' root disk into a DisposableVM (
[mount_lvm_image.sh](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Contents/blob/master/code/OS-administration/mount_lvm_image.sh)
& [mount-lvm-image](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/mount-lvm-image/) )
```console
$ ./mount_lvm_image.sh /dev/qubes_dom0/vm-archlinux-minimal-root fedora-dvm
```
In the newly created DisposableVM, mount that (disk) image and {ch}ange {root}.
```console
# mount /dev/xvdi3 /mnt
# chroot /mnt
```
Then check its systemd-journald entries:
```
[root@disp9786 /]# journalctl -u qubes-mount-dirs

`cmp` definitely needs to be working. So the binary `cmp` is missing, let's find it:
```console
# pacman -Fy cmp
```
It's located in ***`core/diffutils`***, and for some (currently) unknown reason is not installed.
Let's modify the 'archlinux' template builder to add this package. Modify the files `qubes-builder/qubes-src/builder-archlinux/script/packages` to add the ***`diffutils`***, and rebuild the template.
Why this package was not installed in the first place? I am unsure. It could be that it was a dependency of the package ***`xf86dgaproto`*** that was removed few days ago, but I don't have the PKGBUILD of this package since it was deleted, so can't confirm. It can be something else too.
I rebuild the template with those modification, and it is working as expected.
I will send a pull request. Does someone have a better idea on "Why ***`diffutils`*** was not installed in the first place?" ?

## Creating an ArchLinux repository
Once the template have been build, you could use the generated archlinux packages to create your own archlinux repository for QubesOS packages.
You need to:
* Sign the packages with your GPG key
* Host the packages on your HTTP server 

I will assume that you already have a working HTTP server. \
So you need to sign the packages and transmit everything to the qubes that will upload them to your HTTP server.
The script `update-remote-repo.sh` of the "qubes-builder-archlinux" repository can do that.
Below, an example of code that sign the packages + template rpm file, and transmit everything to another qube.
```sh
$directory/qubes-src/builder-archlinux/update-remote-repo.sh
rpmfile=$(ls -1 $directory/qubes-src/linux-template-builder/rpm/noarch/*.rpm | head -n 1)
qubes-gpg-client-wrapper --detach-sign $rpmfile > $rpmfile.sig
qvm-copy $rpmfile
qvm-copy $rpmfile.sig
qvm-copy $directory/qubes-packages-mirror-repo/vm-archlinux/pkgs/
```
Upload everything to your HTTP server, and you are good. 
You can now modify the file `/etc/pacman.d/99-qubes-repository-4.0.conf` in your archlinux template to use your repository.
Example of content for this file (**replace the server URL with your own**): 
```console
[qubes]
Server = https://neowutran.ovh/qubes/vm-archlinux/pkgs
```
### About the package `qubes-vm-keyring`
The goal of this package was to add a **`pacman`** source for the Qubes OS packages, and to set its maintainer GPG key as trusted.
**There are binary packages available (unofficially):**
* https://neowutran.ovh/qubes/vm-archlinux/pkgs (go up a directory for an Arch Linux template built for Qubes OS 4.0.3 only)

If the Qubes OS developers start providing binary packages themselves, the GPG key and fingerprint of the new maintainer(s) might be added in the files below: 
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-agent-linux/blob/master/archlinux/PKGBUILD-keyring-keys
* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-agent-linux/blob/master/archlinux/archlinux/PKGBUILD-keyring-trusted

### StandaloneVM stuff
Having a StandaloneVM for building Qube distro templates would be safer than an AppVM, and wouldn't require reinstalling all dependencies after each VM reboot. \
But if this wasn't chosen over AppVM by default, there must be downsides to a StandaloneVM I'm unable to think of from a lack of knowledge with Qubes' inner workings.

#### Open a terminal in Dom0
```console
# sed -e 's/nodev/dev/g' -e 's/nosuid/suid/g' -i /etc/fstab
```
```console
# qvm-shutdown --wait build-archlinux2;qvm-start build-archlinux2
```

### Was in 5.
Finding if anything in `qubes-builder/` is currently mounted.
```console
$ findmnt
```
`$`Edit: `$HOME/cleanup.sh`
```sh
#!/bin/sh
sudo umount --lazy --recursive "$HOME/qubes-builder/chroot-vm-archlinux/*/"
sudo umount --lazy --recursive "$HOME/qubes-builder/cache/archlinux/bootstrap/*/"
sudo umount --lazy --recursive "$HOME/qubes-builder/qubes-src/linux-template-builder/*/"
sudo rm -Rf "$HOME/qubes-builder/chroot-vm-archlinux/"
sudo rm -Rf "$HOME/qubes-builder/cache/"
```
> **Since --lazy is used, rebooting the VM afterwards will prevent strange problems.**
