How to install Signal Desktop in Qubes
--------------------------------------

**CAUTION:** Before proceeding, please carefully read [On Digital Signatures and Key Verification][qubes-verifying-signatures].
This website cannot guarantee that any PGP key you download from the Internet is authentic.
Always obtain a trusted key fingerprint via other channels, and always check any key you download against your trusted copy of the fingerprint.

The following adapts the official [Linux (Debian-based) Install Instructions][signal-debian-instructions] from Signal's website for Qubes.

1. (Optional) Create a TemplateVM ('debian-11' is used as an example, but could have been 'debian-11-minimal', 'debian-10', etc.):

       [user@dom0 ~]$ sudo qubesctl --skip-dom0 --targets=debian-11 --show-output state.sls update.qubes-vm

2. Open a terminal in Debian 11 (or your previously chosen template ; note that `gnome-terminal` isn't installed by default in minimal templates, in which case replace with `gnome-terminal` with `uxterm`):

       [user@dom0 ~]$ qvm-run -a debian-11 gnome-terminal
       
3. Use these commands in your terminal (if you chose a different distribution, such as `buster`, substitute that for `xenial` in the fourth command):

  Install the curl program needed to download the signal signing key:

       [user@debian-11 ~]$ sudo apt install curl

  We need a notification daemon, otherwise signal will hang the first time you receive a message when the window doesnâ€™t have the focus:
  
       [user@debian-11 ~]$ sudo apt install dunst	# alternatively, install xfce4-notifyd

  Download the signal signing key (we need to pass the `--proxy` argument to `curl` as TemplateVMs access internet through a proxy at localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8082):

       [user@debian-11 ~]$ curl --proxy 127.0.0.1:8082 -s https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee -a /usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

  Add the signal repository:
  
       [user@debian-11 ~]$ echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-keyring.gpg] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list

  Then fetch all repositories (now including the newly added signal repository), bring the TemplateVM up-to-date, and finally install signal:

       [user@debian-11 ~]$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade && sudo apt install --no-install-recommends signal-desktop

4. In case you used a [minimal template]:

    `signal-desktop` requires at the minimum `libatk1.0-0`, `libatk-bridge2.0-0`, `libcups2` and `libgtk-3-0` to run. Those dependencies are automatically installed when installing `xfce4-notifyd`, but if you installed `dunst` you'll have to add them:

       [user@debian-11 ~]$ sudo apt install libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2 libgtk-3-0

       If you haven't done so already, `qubes-core-agent-networking` must be installed for networking to work in qubes based on minimal templates:

       [user@debian-11 ~]$ sudo apt install qubes-core-agent-networking

       Then optionally install the following packages for convenience of handling files (`zenity` is needed by the Qubes OS functions in `qubes-core-agent-nautilus` to show the progress dialog when moving / copying files):

       [user@debian-11 ~]$ sudo apt install nautilus qubes-core-agent-nautilus zenity

5. Shutdown the TemplateVM (substitute your template name if needed):

        [user@dom0 ~]$ qvm-shutdown debian-11
        
6. Create an AppVM based on this TemplateVM.

7. With your mouse, select the `Q` menu -> `Domain: "AppVM Name"` -> `"AppVM Name": Qube Settings` -> `Applications` (or in Qubes Manager `"AppVM Name"` -> `Settings` -> `Applications`). Select `Signal` from the left `Available` column, move it to the right `Selected` column by clicking the `>` button and then `OK` to apply the changes and close the window.
